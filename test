## Scope

-   Define what the SOP is supposed to address, the audience and clearly defined expectations.

## Procedure

### Steps To Be Followed In The Process 

- Break down all the steps for SOP. Ensure steps are well defined, detailed and include decision tree dynamics. 
- Ensure the completion of all steps, includes Jira task management, culminating in the transition of the task in the assignee's swim lane, to the verification stage.
- When referencing tasks, include them in the body of the SOP suing the below format: 
  ""[[02504112316-returns-management-sop.md]]""
  
  ## Due Date Management

-   All due dates are enforced by automation and are based off task creator suggested due date and similar previous task due dates.
-   Ensure all assigned tasks have 'Suggested Due Dates' which will form the basis for the assigned 'Due Date'.
-   This compliance forms a critical part of the KPIs set for each task and any bonus structure assigned to the task.

## KPIs

- Include all relevant KPIs that measure completion of the expectations that are measurable and trackable.
- If any Jira automations needs to be built, outline the steps in the SOP in brief detail.
